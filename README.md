- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/oco-infra.md">**Offensive Cyber Operations Infrastructure Development (In Progress)**</a><br>
Developing and deploying a custom command-and-control infrastructure setup. Using a custom redirector and payload server to perform a professional offensive cyber operations case study. Using red team methodology to protect operational security of deployment.
- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/ad-offsec.md">**Active Directory Offensive Security Testing**</a><br>
Deployed a Windows Server with Active Directory Domain Services to practice and demonstrate initial attack vectors, post-compromise enumeration, and post-compromise attacks. This includes pass-the-hash attacks, kerberoasting, token impersonation, credential-dumping with Mimikatz, and golden ticket attacks.
- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/local-llm.md">**Local, Private, Secure, & Unfiltered LLM Chatbot for Offensive Security Operations**</a><br>
Deployed a local server for hosting unfiltered local large-language models (LLMs) as the backend to a secure browser-based chatbot user interface frontend. This allows an offensive cyber operations team to develop malicious scripts and payloads without exposing data.

Access control policy for the existing overlay mesh network was configured through code. The document was managed with GitOps and Terraform, each being different options to enable remote configuration of the policy file with automatic deployment. Policies allow users and groups of users to authenticate to explicitly allowed resources, with default denied access.
- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/tailscale.md">**Zero-Trust Fabric for Identity-Driven, Application-Aware, & Policy-Defined Resource Access**</a><br>
Designed and deployed a software-defined mesh overlay network on top of the existing physical network plane. Used Tailscale to control routing between devices based on continuous identity authentication, connecting device posture, and application-aware policies. This produced a flat network across multiple LANs with strict access controls between users, devices, and services.
- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/resilience.md">**Onsite & Offsite Backup & Restore for Cyber Resilience of Data & Workloads**</a><br>

- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/web-dev-cloudflare.md">**Frontend Web Design & Development with GitOps & Cloudflare Web Security**</a><br>
Designed and developed a static website with HTML and Tailwind CSS. Used GitOps to automatically deploy code from git repository to website hosting service. Used numerous features of Cloudflare to secure the website, especially availability through DDoS protection and content delivery.
- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/kasm.md">**Remote, Emphemeral, & Isolated Execution Environments for Desktop, Browser, & Email**</a><br>
Deployed server infrastructure for remotely streaming desktop, browser, and email environments to a client web browser. These Kasm Workspace environments are containerized for isolation and security, and are wiped completely after each session.
- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/cicd-iac.md">**Cloud-Native Infrastructure & Workload Automation with GitOps & Infrastructure-as-Code**</a><br>
Used Docker Compose and Terraform to provision virtual servers in a hypervisor and containerized applications in Docker. Used GitOps to store, version control, and distribute configuration files to deploy infrastructure and workloads declaratively and automatically.
- <a href="https://github.com/noah-sec/projects/blob/main/endpoints.md">**Windows Workstation & Linux Server Endpoint Security Hardening**</a><br>
Used CIS Benchmarks to harden Windows 10 workstations and Debian-based Linux servers. Set up a virtual private server (VPS) in Azure cloud with security best practices. Also applied privacy best practices for turning off telemetry in Windows 10.
Physical Network Infrastructure Deployment with Firewalls & Microsegmentation
